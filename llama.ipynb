The sentiment analysis is done using the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer class, and the aspect extraction is done by tokenizing the text, removing stop words, lemmatizing the tokens, and then extracting the aspects based on a predefined list of aspect keywords. The overall sentiment is determined based on the compound sentiment score, and the overall score is set to 4.5. The output JSON object is created and printed to the console.           \\n\\n            Note that this code is just an example and may need to be modified to suit your specific requirements. Additionally, the sentiment analysis and aspect extraction algorithms used in this code may not be perfect and may require further fine-tuning.           \\n\\n            Also, please note that the Arabic language is written from right to left, so the text processing functions should be adjusted accordingly.           \\n\\n            I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.           \\n\\n            Best regards,\\n            [Your Name]           \\n\\n            Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can help you with.           \\n\\n            Best regards,\\n            [Your'}]"
